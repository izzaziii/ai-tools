### Key Trends (Week 19, 2025 in the context of 2024 and preceding weeks in 2025)
- **Declining traffic and engagement:** The traffic and funnel starts have been falling sharply recently, especially given the dramatic dip from week 18 to week 19 in 2025 and the lower performance compared to the previous year.
- **Drop in funnel entry points:** "type_addr" (typing the address, indicating location interest) is especially low relative to prior weeks and the previous year.
- **Lead capture and qualification:** "add_contact" and "add_addr" also dropped sharply, meaning fewer qualified leads and fewer users within the coverage area progressing further.
- **Conversion at checkout and purchase:** While absolute numbers are down, the funnel conversion rates can provide additional context.

*Note: "Add Addr / Add Contact" over 100% likely data inconsistency or users adding address beyond initial lead drop in 2024 data.

**Insights:**
- A significant drop in "type_addr / view_item" indicates fewer users typing addresses after viewing items, pointing to lower engagement or fewer users in serviceable locations in 2025.
- Conversion from type_addr to add_contact has improved drastically, possibly indicating targeting more qualified users who are more likely to provide contacts.
- Further down the funnel, conversion rates from add_date through purchase have also improved significantly, indicating better funnel efficiency among engaged users despite lower overall volume.
- Overall, traffic and funnel starts have decreased, but engagement quality appears better.

### Summary Insights and Recommendations:

- **Sharp Decline in Week 19, 2025:** Compared to previous weeks in 2025 and the same week last year, key metrics including traffic, funnel entries, and purchases dropped by about 25%-60%.
- **Conversion Efficiency Improved:** Despite lower volumes, conversion rates improved at later funnel stages, indicating the site is capturing better-qualified users.
- **Issue at Funnel Top:** The largest drop and difference versus 2024 lies in users typing addresses after viewing items. This suggests a potential issue with geographic targeting, service coverage communication, or user interest in coverage areas.
- **Service Coverage Area Impact:** Substantial drop in add_addr suggests we should review service availability info and targeting; better communicating coverage or expanding coverage may help.
- **Traffic Volume:** The big drop in traffic volume is highly impactful. Reassess marketing channels or seasonality effects causing this drop.
- **Further Investigation Needed:**
  - Check if there are any external factors (marketing spend, competitors, seasonality).
  - Look into website changes affecting funnel entry steps.
  - Explore geographic traffic breakdown to confirm if coverage areas are shrinking or users are discouraged.

If you need, I can drill down into specific weeks or do segmented analysis (by geography, campaign, device, etc.) if that data is available.
