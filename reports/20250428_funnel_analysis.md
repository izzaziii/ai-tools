### 2. Comparisons with Previous Year (Week 17, 2024)
**Week 17, 2024:**
- Traffic: 118,143
- View Item: 5,160
- Type Address: 4,835
- Add Contact: 1,171
- Add Address: 1,361
- Add Date: 724
- Checkout: 582
- Purchase: 424

**Insights:**
- **Traffic** increased by 62.4% YoY (191,941 vs 118,143)
- **View Item** increased by 27.7% (6,592 vs 5,160) — funnel start has grown
- **Type Address** dropped substantially by 65.5% YoY (1,668 vs 4,835)
- **Add Contact** dropped modestly by 8.3% (1,074 vs 1,171)
- **Add Address** dropped by 33.1% (910 vs 1,361)
- **Add Date** dropped by 20% (579 vs 724)
- **Checkout** dropped by 7.7% (537 vs 582)
- **Purchase** dropped by 3.5% (409 vs 424)

While overall website traffic and View Item stage are significantly higher than the previous year indicating more user interest or successful outreach, deeper funnel steps like Type Address, Add Address, Checkout and Purchase are all lower compared with previous year week 17.

This suggests the user journey might have changed or quality of traffic might have shifted, resulting in lower downstream engagement in the funnel despite higher upfront interest or visits.

### 3. Key Trends (Looking at Weeks 10-17, 2025 for recent trends)
- Traffic shows an **upwards trend**, reaching the highest point at week 17.
- View Item has increased steadily but with some fluctuation — Week 17 is the highest in this period.
- Type Address fluctuates but significantly lower than 2024 levels; seems disconnected from traffic and view item increase.
- Add Contact and Add Address trend is stable but generally slightly down compared to the previous year.
- Checkout and Purchase numbers despite minor fluctuations, peaked at week 17 over these weeks, indicating improved conversion performance more recently.

### 4. Funnel & Conversion Rate Analysis (Week 17, 2025)
| Funnel Stage              | Count  | Rate wrt Previous Stage | Rate wrt Traffic |
|--------------------------|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| Traffic                  | 191,941| -                      | 100.0%           |
| View Item                | 6,592  | 3.44%                  | 3.44%            |
| Type Address             | 1,668  | 25.3%                  | 0.87%            |
| Add Contact (Leads Drop) | 1,074  | 64.4%                  | 0.56%            |
| Add Address              | 910    | 84.7%                  | 0.47%            |
| Add Date                 | 579    | 63.6%                  | 0.30%            |
| Checkout                 | 537    | 92.7%                  | 0.28%            |
| Purchase                 | 409    | 76.1%                  | 0.21%            |

**Key points:**
- From Traffic to View Item: 3.44% users start conversion by viewing item.
- Largest drop-off is from View Item to Type Address (75% drop), which is quite steep.
- From Type Address to Add Contact, conversion recovers to 64.4%, indicating leads drop form is effective for those who type address.
- High retention (>84%) from Add Contact to Add Address indicates service coverage filtering is relatively efficient.
- Drop from Add Address to Add Date is 36.4%, potentially scheduling friction.
- Very good retention from Add Date to Checkout (92.7%) and Checkout to Purchase (76.1%) - checkout funnel looks optimized.

### **Summary and Recommendations**

**Overview:**

- The last week of April 2025 (week 17) recorded the **highest traffic and View Item** users in recent history.
- Purchases also increased strongly vs previous week (by 20%) showing good recent performance.
- However, compared to the same week in 2024, despite more traffic and initial interest, key funnel stages like typing address and purchase are slightly declining (especially Type Address, a critical step).
- The funnel shows a **very big drop-off from View Item to Type Address** (only ~25% proceed), indicating potential user friction or mismatch at this stage.
- Once users type an address, conversion downstream from lead capture to purchase is relatively strong and stable.

**Recommendations:**

- Analyze why users are dropping off after View Item but before typing address: check UX, form complexity, unclear communication about coverage.
- Investigate the causes of lower Type Address rates relative to 2024 even with higher traffic -- potential quality issues or targeting.
- Potentially improve qualification messaging to better prepare users for coverage check to reduce drop-off.
- Maintain and enhance checkout and purchase funnel optimizations shown to convert well.
- Given the strong increases in traffic and View Item, focus on **improving mid-funnel engagement** can unlock more overall conversions.
