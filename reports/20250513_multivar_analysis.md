            "traffic_to_view_item (0.0412)": "Strong positive correlation with overall traffic volume; weeks with higher traffic tend to maintain or improve this rate, indicating consistent interest in item listings.",
            "view_item_to_type_addr (0.198)": "Converts a smaller segment of users progressing from browsing to intent signals; this rate has highest volatility and dips correlate with UX changes or external factors reducing user engagement.",
            "type_addr_to_add_contact (0.572)": "Moderate to strong correlation with quality of address input experience and user confidence; improvements here tend to boost downstream funnel steps.",
            "add_contact_to_add_addr (0.785)": "High conversion rate suggests this step is well optimized; low variance over weeks reflects a stable user behavior pattern once initial intention is established.",
            "add_addr_to_add_date (0.601)": "Slightly lower rate with some week-to-week fluctuations; may be sensitive to clarity or perceived value of scheduling options offered.",
            "add_date_to_checkout (0.883)": "Consistently high rate with minimal anomalies; critical step showing strong user commitment.",
            "checkout_to_purchase (0.729)": "Moderate variance; drop-offs here often align with payment method issues or trust signals impacting final conversion.",
            "traffic_to_purchase (0.00287)": "Overall funnel conversion rate is low as expected; mostly driven by cumulative impact of earlier funnel bottlenecks."

            "Negative Patterns": [
                "Drops in view_item_to_type_addr conversion rate appear strongly associated with reduced overall traffic_to_purchase, underscoring its role as a critical bottleneck.",
                "Weeks with dip in add_addr_to_add_date sometimes coincide with slight declines in add_date_to_checkout, suggesting compounded friction in scheduling and checkout progression."

            "Anomaly Patterns": [

    "summary_insights": [
        "The most impactful conversion metric is the view_item_to_type_addr step, acting as a key gatekeeper for downstream funnel success; its significant anomaly this week explains overall funnel weakness.",
        "Stable high conversion rates in later funnel stages indicate those aspects of the user journey are currently well optimized and less problematic.",
        "Improvement efforts should prioritize addressing the UX and engagement challenges at the item-to-address input transition to maximize conversion lift.",
        "Continuous monitoring of add_addr_to_add_date conversion is recommended due to its sensitivity to scheduling UI/UX changes and its influence on subsequent funnel steps."
