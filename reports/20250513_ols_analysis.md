**Insight:**  
Most metrics dropped week-over-week, with the largest declines seen in earlier funnel stages such as "Add Contact" (-13.9%) and "Add Address" (-13.1%). Purchase completed also declined by 5%. This suggests a general decrease in traffic and conversions through the funnel for week 19 compared to week 18.

#### 3. Comparison with Same Week Previous Year (Week 19, 2024-05-12)

| Metric       | Week 19, 2024 (2024-05-12) | Week 19, 2025 (2025-05-11) | Change       | % Change  |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------|

**Insight:**  
- Traffic and View Item users increased significantly year-over-year (53.6% and 25.5% increase respectively), indicating higher site visits and more users entering the funnel top.
- However, there is a substantial decrease in the "Type Address" and subsequent funnel steps in 2025 vs 2024 for the same week: "Type Address" down by 66.6%, "Add Address" down by 37.4%, and "Purchase" down by 9.3%.
- This suggests problems or changes affecting users who progress past the early funnel steps, especially those involving address input and qualifying within coverage area.

#### 4. Key Trends (2024 - 2025)

- **Traffic & Top Funnel Metrics:** Traffic and users entering the funnel ("view_item") have generally increased compared to the previous year.
- **Drop-off deeper in funnel:** The biggest drop-offs occur around "type_addr," "add_addr," and further steps involving user qualification (availability in coverage).
- **Conversion rates from add_contact to purchase** have slightly worsened or declined year-over-year, indicating potential friction in lead qualification or follow-up steps.

#### 5. Funnel and Conversion Rate Analysis for Week 19 (2025-05-11)

| Funnel Stage       | Count | % of Traffic | % Conversion from Previous Stage |
|--------------------|-------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Traffic            | 189,727 | 100%       | -                               |
| View Item          | 6,580  | 3.47%        | 3.47%                           |
| Type Address       | 1,471  | 0.78%        | 22.3%                          |
| Add Contact        | 1,025  | 0.54%        | 69.7%                          |
| Add Address        | 878    | 0.46%        | 85.7%                          |
| Add Date           | 580    | 0.31%        | 66.1%                          |
| Checkout           | 530    | 0.28%        | 91.4%                          |
| Purchase           | 399    | 0.21%        | 75.3%                          |

**Insights:**
- Only 3.47% of total users start the funnel by viewing an item, which is typical for a telecom conversion funnel.
- There is a large drop between "view_item" and "type_addr" (77.7% drop), indicating a major barrier here, possibly address verification issues or user hesitation.
- After typing address, conversion rates through the funnel are high (>65%), especially from "add_contact" to "purchase" (~39% from contact added to purchase).
- Checkout to Purchase conversion stands strong at 75.3%, showing efficiency at the final purchase step.

### Summary and Recommendations

- **Week 19 vs Week 18 (2025):** There is a short-term decline in traffic and funnel activity by around 5-14% across metrics, including purchases (-5%). This could be typical fluctuation or related to external factors needing communication monitoring.
- **Year-over-Year performance:** Traffic and funnel entry point ("view_item") saw a strong increase (>25%), but a sharp decline in "type_addr" usage suggests a problem or changed user behavior at the address input step; possible causes could be website changes, address coverage issues, or UI/UX problems.
- **Funnel Bottleneck:** The largest funnel drop happens at "type_addr," where most users drop out. Since your service's coverage depends on address location, this might be users discovering they aren’t within coverage or addressing difficulties with the address input process.
- **Conversion Efficiency:** Subsequent funnel steps show good conversion rates (~70-90%) for users who pass the address typing stage.

---

### Recommendations:

1. **Investigate 'Type Address' Drop-off:**  
   - Examine possible reasons for the sharp year-over-year decline at this step.
   - Perform UX tests to see if there are any issues with the address input or validation.
   - Review if wider coverage or communication about coverage areas needs enhancement.

2. **Boost Traffic Quality:**  
   - While traffic increased year-over-year, fewer users progress beyond address typing.
   - Target campaigns to attract traffic from known covered areas to reduce irrelevant visitors.

3. **Optimize Funnel for Coverage Area:**  
   - Clearly communicate service coverage upfront or provide a quick coverage check tool to avoid wasted funnel progression.
   - Improve messaging post "type_addr" to retain and guide users better.

4. **Monitor Week-to-Week Fluctuations:**  
   - Week 19 2025 showed declines across all funnel metrics relative to week 18, monitor if this is a short-lived dip or negative trend.
