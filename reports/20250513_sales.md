### 4. Key Trends Over Time (Seasonal and Overall)

- **Dealer Sales:** Show seasonality and fluctuations with overall stable growth from 2021 to 2025 but some dips in certain weeks.
- **Inside Sales:** Were zero or negligible through 2021-early 2023; gradually appearing and growing from mid/late 2023 through 2024 and into 2025. This channel is emerging as a significant contributor to direct sales.
- **Online Sales:** Generally consistent with modest growth, key to consumer direct acquisition.
- **Direct Sales:** Shows gradual growth influenced by rising inside sales combined with steady online sales.

### 5. Multivariate Analysis & Correlations

- **Dealer vs Direct Sales:** Dealer sales and direct sales channels appear somewhat independent. Direct sales do not directly correlate strongly with dealer sales. Dealer sales may be influenced by coverage area and dealer network activity separately.
- **Inside Sales vs Online Sales:** Moderate positive correlation. Weeks with higher inside sales often correspond to weeks with higher online sales, suggesting possible coordinated marketing efforts or overall demand patterns.
- **Inside Sales impact:** Increasing inside sales are strongly associated with rises in direct sales, indicating inside sales are driving more direct customers lately.

### 6. Outliers/Anomalies

- **Week 7, 2024 (DEALER = 999),** the dealer sales dropped sharply compared to surrounding weeks (~1500-2000 normally). Likely an anomaly or disruption in dealer channel.
- **Inside sales in early years (2021-2022) are all zero**, indicating this channel was either non-existent or not recorded during that time.
- **Sudden spikes in inside sales in 2023, particularly from week 31 onwards**, may indicate a change in reporting or a strategic shift to inside sales.
- **Week 10 of 2024:** Inside sales spiked to 112 from lower values (~50 before), and week 11 to 136, signaling a significant ramp-up which continues increasing afterward.

---

### Summary and Recommendations:

- **Latest week (2025, week 19)** shows healthy growth in direct sales, with inside sales particularly strong, suggesting telesales as a key rising channel.
- Dealer sales also improved compared to last year and previous weeks, implying balance across channels.
- Online sales remain stable, underpinning the direct channel.
- The emergence and growth of inside sales is the most notable channel trend, reflecting investments in telesales/inside sales may be paying off.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Continue to invest and optimize inside sales team and campaigns since they strongly contribute to direct sales growth.
  - Monitor online channel for opportunities to increase conversions; it remains a critical customer acquisition lever.
  - Investigate any anomalous dealer sales drops (e.g., 2024 week 7) for operational risks.
  - Use multivariate insights to coordinate marketing between inside and online channels for synergy.
