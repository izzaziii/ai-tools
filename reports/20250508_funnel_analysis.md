  "insights": [
    "The primary funnel bottlenecks are at the transition from viewing an item to typing the address, and from adding an address to adding a date, both showing notable declines.",
    "Low conversion early in the funnel (view_item to type_addr) suggests possible issues with item appeal, clarity, or the ease of starting the purchase process.",
    "Drop at add_addr to add_date indicates potential confusion or friction at scheduling or timing selection stage.",
    "Stable checkout to purchase rate indicates those who reach the final stages maintain confidence to complete purchase.",
    "Action is recommended to investigate UX/UI changes or external factors impacting address entry and scheduling steps to restore conversion rates.",
    "Addressing these early and mid-funnel issues will be critical to improving overall conversion efficiency and maximizing purchase volume."
